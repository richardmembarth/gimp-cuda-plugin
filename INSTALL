INSTALL NOTES
=============

This plugin was developed and tested on the following platforms:
- GNU/Linux & GIMP 2.8
- Mac OS X 10.8.2 & GIMP 2.8


1. Requirements:
----------------
Hardware:
you need a CUDA-enabled GPU: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_gpus.html

Software:
you need the following programs/dev-libs:

- CUDA driver and toolkit: http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html

- gimp2.x: (http://www.gimp.org) (you may also need the gimp-dev libs on some
  Linux distributions in order to get gimptool-2.0)


2. Configuration:
-----------------
Before building the plugin you may need to adjust at least the following
variables at the very top of the Makefile depending on your system:

CUDAROOT        CUDA runtime libraries and includes reside
                default: /opt/cuda
INSTALL_PATH    installation path of the plugin
                default (GNU/Linux): $(HOME)/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins
                default (Mac OS X): $(HOME)/Library/GIMP/2.8/plug-ins

The following variables can be adjusted in defines_cpu.hpp:
MAX_SIGMA_D     the maximal possible geometric spread for the bilateral filter
MAX_SIGMA_R     the maximal possible photometric spread for the filter
PRINT_TIMES     when this macro is defined, timings of the filter
                implementations are printed to stderr


3. Install:
-----------
make
make install

Afterwards you'll find in the gimp menu under "Filters->Enhance" the entry
"Multiresolution gradient adaptive filter"

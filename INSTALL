INSTALL NOTES
=============

This plugin was developed and tested on the following platforms:
- Gentoo Linux 2008.0 (x86_64; Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo; GeForce 8400): GIMP 2.4 & 2.6
- openSUSE 10.2 (x86; Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4; GeForce 8800 GTS): GIMP 2.2
- Ubuntu 8.04 (x86_64; Intel Q9550; GeForce GTX 280): GIMP 2.6
- Mac OS X 10.5.6 (i686-apple-darwin9; Intel Core 2 Duo; GeForce 9400M): GIMP 2.6


1. Requirements:
----------------
Hardware:
you need a CUDA-enabled GPU:
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_gpus.html

Software:
you need the following programs/dev-libs:

CUDA driver, toolkit, and SDK (CUDA 3.0 or above; should also work with CUDA
versions starting from 2.0):
http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html

gimp2.x: (http://www.gimp.org/) (you may also need the gimp-dev libs on some
linux distributions in order to get gimptool-2.0)


2. Configuration:
-----------------
Before building the plugin you may need to adjust at least the following
variables at the very top of the Makefile depending on your system/linux
distribution:

CUDA_SDK_PATH   location of the CUDA SDK
                default: /opt/cuda/sdk
CUDAROOT        cuda runtime libraries and includes reside
                default: /opt/cuda
GIMP_TOOL       path to gimptool, provided by gimp
                default: /usr/bin/gimptool-2.0
INSTALL_PATH    installation path of the plugin
                default: $(HOME)/.gimp-2.6/plug-ins/

The following variables can be adjusted in defines_cpu.hpp:
MAX_SIGMA_D     the maximal possible geometric spread for the bilateral filter
MAX_SIGMA_R     the maximal possible photometric spread for the filter
PRINT_TIMES     when this macro is defined, timings of the filter
                implementations are printed to stderr


3. Install:
-----------
make
make install

Afterwards you'll find in the gimp menu under Filters->Enhance the entry
"Multiresolution gradient adaptive filter"
